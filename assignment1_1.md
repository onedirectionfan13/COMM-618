Top Health and Nutrition Trends for 2026 by U.S. News & World Report
https://health.usnews.com/wellness/food/articles/top-health-and-nutrition-trends-for-2026
This report uses survey data from a panel of 58 health experts to identify the most significant health and nutrition trends expected to shape 2026. The data is used to rank trends and quantify expert consensus through percentages, such as the share of experts who selected GLP-1 medications, AI-integrated wearable technology, or food as medicine as top trends. The article uses survey results from medical experts to educate the audience about medical information anyone can use to make an informed decision about living a healthier life.
The article clearly presents the data source, both within the report and at the end, with links and citations. The story does not link to any raw survey results, but I believe you can request it separately. The article explicitly states the sample size used. 
One strength of the story is how it balances numbers with expert commentary. Quotes from physicians and dietitians help contextualize why certain trends, such as GLP-1 expansion or increased fiber intake, matter beyond immediate results. The article also cautions readers against over-reliance on technology, emphasizing professional guidance and basic nutrition principles. I can appreciate this, as when reporting on sensitive topics, or health and wellness, it’s important to keep the reader's safety in mind. The reader is most likely reading a health article to learn about how a new medication or development in the health world could personally affect them, so adding in safety measures to the article is a good addition. The data is presented in a written article and includes charts for visualization. This approach is effective for readability, as eyes often look for pictures in an article to skip around while reading.
