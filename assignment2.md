Hello Editor, 

I am looking to report on how much asylum outcomes in U.S. immigration courts depend on the specific judge assigned to a case. To explore this, I’m proposing to use judge-by-judge asylum decision data compiled by TRAC Reports, which tracks asylum outcomes in immigration courts from fiscal years 2020 through 2025. This dataset is newsworthy because it represents a high-stakes situation: whether asylum is granted, denied, or resolved. 

The data is segmented by individual judges and courts, enabling comparisons both within the same court and across jurisdictions. The data also indicates substantial variation in denial rates among judges working in the same locations, raising important accountability questions about the asylum system. This dataset is vetted against TRAC’s documentation on how the data are collected and categorized, using Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) records.

Thank you, 
Kelly
