Lebanese Americans are sustaining families through Lebanon’s economic collapse—but experts warn that reliance on diaspora aid may be entrenching the very system that failed them.
As Lebanon’s financial collapse enters its seventh year, Lebanese Americans across the United States are sending money, medicine, and basic supplies to relatives back home, filling gaps left by a state unable to provide essential services.
The financial crisis, triggered by a 2019 banking collapse and compounded by inflation, war, and political paralysis, has hollowed out Lebanon’s economy and public institutions. As unemployment soars and services fail, diaspora support has shifted from occasional assistance to a primary survival mechanism for millions. 
While remittances keep families afloat, experts warn that growing reliance on the diaspora may delay political accountability and deepen Lebanon’s long-term institutional breakdown.
After the 2019 financial crash, remittances stopped functioning as supplemental support and became essential income. In practice, remittances have replaced the state's role, functioning as Lebanon’s informal welfare system, according to Dania Arayssi, a political scientist at the University of Colorado who studies the political effects of remittances. 
“Currently, the unemployment rate is almost 30 or 40 percent, so people are unemployed, and the only source of income to pay bills and put food on the table is money coming from migrants outside,” Arayssi said.
She further explained that state institutions have eroded to the point where households cannot rely on public services.

The economic collapse has transformed outside support into a national survival mechanism.
After Lebanon’s banking system effectively froze in 2019—leaving depositors unable to access their own money and triggering a currency collapse—money transfer agencies such as Western Union and MoneyGram expanded to fill the void, according to Arayssi.
In her research, Arayssi found that the surge in remittances over the past few years is affecting political behavior.
Arayssi’s survey research found that households receiving remittances are less likely to vote in a political election.
“They don’t need to engage in political action like voting,” she said, “because they know it’s not going to be effective. The Lebanese government has never produced a government that is truly responsive to people’s demands.”
Instead, families turn to informal survival strategies such as petitioning local officials for small services — electricity repairs, trash removal — rather than pushing for structural reform. Arayssi called this “selective political engagement,” a coping mechanism that helps families survive but weakens democratic accountability over time.
A tax on outward remittances included in a sweeping federal appropriations package signed into law in July — informally dubbed the “big, beautiful bill” after President Donald Trump’s description of the legislation — may add friction.
The provision, aimed at discouraging capital outflows from the United States, places a levy on money transfers sent abroad, affecting migrant communities who regularly support families overseas.
Even a small charge, Arayssi said, could push migrants toward untraceable, informal channels.
Arayassi also said that gender and social expectations shape how families experience remittances.
“There’s less guilt for a man because he’s the ‘breadwinner,’” she said. “But when a woman migrates and sends money home, her mother feels guilt, because she was never expected to provide. Gender and class shape these emotions deeply.”
